# Y100_FinalProject_Bootcamp
For the next two weeks, you'll be a junior analyst who's about to solve their first real tasks from major customers. 
You'll work simultaneously on a big project and on minor tasks, much like in real life.

A/B Testing Project Part
Task:
You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). 
They left only the technical specifications and the test results.
Instructions for completing the task:
-Describe the goals of the study.
-Explore the data:
  -Do types need to be converted?
  -Are there any missing or duplicate values? If so, how would you characterize them?
-Carry out exploratory data analysis:
  -Study conversion at different stages of the funnel.
  -Is the number of events per user distributed equally among the samples?
  -Are there users who are present in both samples?
  -How is the number of events distributed among days?
  -Are there any peculiarities in the data that you have to take into account before starting the A/B test?
-Evaluate the A/B test results:
  -What can you say about the A/B test results?
  -Use a z-test to check the statistical difference between the proportions.
-Describe your conclusions regarding the EDA stage and the A/B test results.

SQL Project Part
The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; 
more people were home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.
You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. 
This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.
Task:
-Find the number of books released after January 1, 2000.
-Find the number of user reviews and the average rating for each book.
-Identify the publisher that has released the greatest number of books with more than 50 pages (this will help you exclude brochures and similar publications from your analysis).
-Identify the author with the highest average book rating: look only at books with at least 50 ratings.
-Find the average number of text reviews among users who rated more than 50 books.
Instructions for completing the task:
-Describe the goals of the study.
-Study the tables (print the first rows).
-Make an SQL query for each of the tasks.
-Output the results of each query in the Notebook.
-Describe your conclusions for each of the tasks.

Final Project Python Part
The virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe is developing some new functions that will give supervisors information on the clients with non-optimal plans.
Customer Service Manager had given us a task of finding clients that overpay for their plans and determine if we should suggest them to switch to another tariff. 
We know this will add to customers' loyalty but in the same time we don't want to lose too mush profit.
Task: find clients who overpay and decide if we should suggest them to switch tariff.
Plan of work:
-Download the data and study the general information
-Data preprocessing
  -Duplicated rows
  -Missing values
  -Merging tables
-Exploratory data analysis
-Aggregating tables and calculating payment size
-Finding clients with non-optimal plans
-Various scenarios and their impact on profit
-Statistical tests
-General conclusions
